Click it, or not? Thats what this project deals with. A statistical project that determines if a website is clickbait or not, and presents a nice Shiny App representation of the findings.
Parsed through Daily Mail, CNN, New York Post, and USA Today to retrieve raw text data. Analyzed the raw text and gave each article a sentiment score. Compared the different scores of differing sources in the Shiny App.
